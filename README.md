# Topsis-for-Pretrained-Models-Text-Classification

This repository explores the application of TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) to evaluate and rank pre-trained text classification models. It delves into the challenges of comparing model performance when faced with multiple metrics and provides a structured approach for prioritizing models based on specific criteria.
